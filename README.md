# Customer-Segmentation

This repository contains code and resources for customer segmentation using three popular clustering algorithms: K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, and Self-Organizing Maps (SOM). Customer segmentation is a crucial task for businesses to understand and tailor their marketing strategies based on distinct customer groups.



# Introduction

Customer segmentation is the process of dividing customers into groups based on shared characteristics such as behavior, preferences, or demographics. In this project, we explore three clustering unsupervised models to perform customer segmentation:

K-Means: A centroid-based clustering algorithm that partitions customers into K clusters based on similarity.

Hierarchical Clustering: A technique that creates a hierarchy of clusters, revealing both major and minor customer segments.

Self-Organizing Maps (SOM): An unsupervised learning algorithm that maps high-dimensional data onto a low-dimensional grid, preserving topological relationships.


# Data

InvoiceNo: A unique identifier for each transaction or invoice.

StockCode: A code or identifier associated with a specific product or item in the inventory.

Description: A textual description or name of the product corresponding to the StockCode.

Quantity: The quantity of the product or item sold in a particular transaction.

InvoiceDate: The timestamp indicating when the transaction occurred or when the invoice was issued.

UnitPrice: The price of a single unit of the product or item.

CustomerID: A unique identifier for each customer, linking transactions to specific individuals.

Country: The country where the customer is located or where the transaction took place.

# Machine Learning Models used

1) K - Means
2) Self-Organizing Maps (SOM)
3) Hierarchial Clustering

# Goal

The goal of the customer segmentation project is to categorize customers into distinct groups based on their behavior, preferences, and transaction history. By leveraging machine learning clustering algorithms such as K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, and Self-Organizing Maps (SOM), the project aims to identify meaningful segments within the customer base. This segmentation is crucial for tailoring marketing strategies, optimizing product recommendations, and enhancing overall customer experience.
